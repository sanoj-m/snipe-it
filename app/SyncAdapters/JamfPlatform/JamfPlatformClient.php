/**
 * Thin wrapper around the Jamf Platform API. Owns auth and pagination
 * for the endpoints the sync adapter uses. Yields raw decoded JSON, no
 * normalization (that's the adapter's job).
 *
 * Product context: Jamf's Platform API (GA September 2025) is a single
 * gateway that fronts multiple Jamf products, including what used to be
 * Jamf Now (blueprints + basic device inventory) alongside cross-product
 * workflows. Customers previously on Jamf Now authenticate here, and
 * customers on Jamf Pro or Jamf School can also use this endpoint for
 * their cross-product needs. Jamf Pro's rich per-product API and Jamf
 * School's Network-ID basic-auth API stay in their own adapters
 * (JamfAdapter and JamfSchoolAdapter) because Platform does not subsume
 * their full surface yet.
 *
 * Auth model: OAuth 2.0 client credentials. The admin creates an
 * integration in Jamf Account, grants it the capabilities it needs,
 * and copies the client id + client secret plus the environment UUID
 * into this adapter's settings. This client exchanges those for a
 * 15-minute bearer token at /auth/token and caches it on the instance
 * so a full-fleet pull does not re-authenticate on every request.
 *
 * Required request headers:
 *   - Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
 *   - X-Environment-Id: <UUID>
 *   - Accept: application/json
 *
 * Jamf Platform API reference: https://developer.jamf.com/platform-api/
